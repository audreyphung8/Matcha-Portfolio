# Matcha-Portfolio üçµ

This is my matcha website where I showcase the different ways I have prepared my matchas and share my favorite matcha brands, milk, and sweeteners that go best with it! I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages to build this website as well as various data structures
such as Arrays and Objects to make it more interactive. 

## Features

- Home Tab: A catalog of the matcha drinks that I have made. 
- Make a Matcha Tab: Click on the different options to make your own perfect matcha latte virtually while learning about the flavor profiles of each blend.
